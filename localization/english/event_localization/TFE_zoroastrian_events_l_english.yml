TFE_zoroastrian.0001.desc:0 "Rumours have made my court that a man that goes by the name of #italic Mazdak #! has reached an impressive amount of following over the last few days. Of Persian stock, he was blessed with the task of reciting the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.ReligiousText]. While a bright man of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], he has taken it upon himself to reinterpret the old teachings of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.ReligiousText] and is now preaching in $b_an-numaniya$ a fresh take on them. \n\nAcording to #italic Mazdak #!, we should express our faith in brotherly love and in making sure all men and women are treated equally and with respect!"

Similar to mazdakism, this faith believes in pacifism and reincranation after death.\n\nThese new people seem to not want to be held under a non-zoroastrian yoke and should be handled carefully."
